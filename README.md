Responses to questions:

1. So far the easiest thing is the syntax and tags. Viewing the site as a tree really helps to visualize what goes where.

2. The difficulties that I am having is using MDN for assistance then finding multiple solutions to a problem or question.

3. The issues that I had run into were easily solved with a short trip to MDN, after some digging and rational thought I had found the solution.
