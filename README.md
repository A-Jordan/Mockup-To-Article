What new skills have you learned?
  
What has been easy?
  
What has been difficult?
  
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Responses to questions:

1. I learned a few new element tags. 

2. So far the easiest thing is the syntax and tags. Viewing the site as a tree really helps to visualize what goes where.

3. The difficulties that I am having is using MDN for assistance then finding multiple solutions to a problem or question.

4. The issues that I had run into were easily solved with a short trip to MDN, after some digging and rational thought I had found the solution.
